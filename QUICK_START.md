## ‚ùì Something Not Working?

### Step 1: Check the Log File

Open **`outlook_reader.log`** in the same folder

Look for:
```
Successfully connected to Outlook. Inbox contains X items.
Processed X/X messages successfully
Successfully built X conversation(s)
```

### Step 2: Common Issues

**No conversations showing?**
- Check if your Outlook inbox is empty
- Check if log shows "Inbox contains 0 items"
- See `TROUBLESHOOTING_CONVERSATIONS.md` for detailed help

**Connection error?**
- Make sure Outlook is installed
- Verify Outlook is configured with email account
- Try opening Outlook manually first
- Check `outlook_reader.log` for specific error

**Module not found?**
- Run `Run_GUI_App.bat` (not Python directly)
- It will auto-install missing dependencies
