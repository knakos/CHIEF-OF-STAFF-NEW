GitHub Upload Instructions
==========================

Your local git repository has been initialized and committed.

To upload to GitHub, follow these steps:

STEP 1: Create a new GitHub repository
---------------------------------------
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: outlook-inbox-reader (or choose your own)
3. Description: Python tool to read Outlook inbox via COM interface with conversation grouping
4. Choose Public or Private
5. DO NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click "Create repository"

STEP 2: Push your code to GitHub
---------------------------------
After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

For a new repository:
  git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/outlook-inbox-reader.git
  git branch -M main
  git push -u origin main

Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username.

Quick Copy-Paste (update YOUR_USERNAME):
-----------------------------------------
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/outlook-inbox-reader.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

You'll be prompted for your GitHub credentials or authentication.

Done!
-----
Your project will be live on GitHub after the push completes.
